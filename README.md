# thy-notification
## Motivation
Prometheus is awesome monitoring tool for kubernetes cluster. 
But you have to handle config files to route alert messages.
thy-notification provides web UI so that you can route alert messages using web browser.

## Features
- Provides centralized notification service for alarm or alert message.
- Provides UI to manage target addresses such as phone numbers (mobile), email addresses and slack webhook address, etc.
- Supports prometheus alertmanager's webhook request.

# How to run
- Download thy-notification.tar.gz file from https://github.com/thyun/thy-notification/releases
- Unzip the file, change to the home directory and run the following
  - java -jar thy-notification.jar
- Access http://localhost:8080/ in your browser

# Config files
- config/application.yml

# Usage
### 1) Edit config/application.yml
Modify application.alertmanager.targetKey value if needed.
The targetKey is generated using incomming alertmanager's webhook request.
The following example shows targetKey is generated by team name so that you can route messages by team name. 
```
application:
  alertmanager:
    targetKey: team:{{ .commonLabels.team }}
```

### 2) Register target addresses for your targetKey
- Access thy-notifications's targets page. (/targets)
- Register target addresses for each team.
For example, if team name is devops you have to register a target using targetKey value as team:devops

# Test
You can send prometheus alertmanager's webhook request to thy-notification like below.
Verify the message is send to all the target addresses.

```aidl
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/alertmanager -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
